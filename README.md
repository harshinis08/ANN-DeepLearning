# ANN-DeepLearning

Used Aritificial Neural Network to classify the Iris dataset into 3 different classes - 
* Iris Setosa 
* Iris Versicolour 
* Iris Virginica


This problem can be solved using Support Vector Machines or other classification algorithms but using Neural Networks, we could achieve a accuracy of 97% which is better than the other classification algorithms.

* Implemented a Sequential model with 2 hidden layers with 10 nodes each and used 'Relu' activation function in the input and hidden layers.
